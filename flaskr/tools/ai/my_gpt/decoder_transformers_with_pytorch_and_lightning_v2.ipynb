    "\n",
    "In order to keep track of our simple dataset,\n",
    "we'll create a dictionary that maps the words and tokens to ID numbers.

Then we will use the dictionary to create a **Dataloader** that contains the questions and the desired answers encoded as ID numbers. Ultimately we'll use the **Dataloader** to train the transformer. **NOTE:** Dataloaders are designed to scale to very large datasets, so this simple example should be useful even when you have a terabyte of text.\n",

    "**ALSO NOTE:** The **inputs** and **labels** for the training data used with a Decoder-Only Transformer can seem a little strange at first. This is because a Decoder-Only Transformer generates a lot of the user input in addition to the response. To get a sense of what this means, let's pretend we want to train our Decoder-Only Transformer to answer the question **What is StatQuest?** with the response **Awesome**. In the figure below, on the left side, we see that the first token in the input **What** generates the output **is**. During training, we can compare this output to the known second token in the input, and if it is different, use that difference to modify the weights and biases in the model. Thus, even though **is** is part of the **input**, it is also part of the **label** that we use to evaluate how well the Decoder-Only Transformer is performing and whether or not the weights and biases should be changed. Likewise, **StatQuest**, **<\\EOS>**, and **awesome** can also be in both the **input** and in the **label** because we know we want the Decoder-Only Transformer to use them as inputs and generate them as outputs."

    "Position Encoding helps the transformer keep track of the order of the words in the input and the output. For example, in the picture below, we see that the two phrases **Squatch eats pizza** and **Pizza eats Squatch** both have the exact same words, but, due to differences in the word order, have very different meanings. Thus, keeping track of word order is very important.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are a bunch of ways for a transformer to keep track of word order, but one popular method is to use a series of alternating sine and cosine curves (seen below). The number of sine and cosine curves depends on how many numbers, or word embedding values, we use to represent each token. In the context of Transformers, the number of numbers, or word embedding values, we use to represent each token is the **dimension** of the transformer. So, if the transformer's dimension is 2, meaning that it uses 2 numbers to represent each token, then we only need one sine and one cosine to generate two position encoding values. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/pos_encoding_1.png\" alt=\"Sine and cosine squiggles for position encoding\" style=\"width: 800px;\">\n",

    "\n",
    "As we see in the illustration above, the additional pair of sine and cosine curves have a wider period (they repeat less frequently) than the first pair. Increasing the period for each additional pair of curves ensures that each position is represented by a unique combination of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The reason why we are bothering to create a class to do positional encoding, instead of just adding this code directly to the transformer, is that we can easily re-use it in an Encoder-Only Transformer or an Encoder-Decoder Transformer. So, by creating a class that does positional encoding, we can code it once, and then just create instances when and where we need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ALSO NOTE:** Since the position encoding values never change, meaning that the first token always uses the same position encoding values regardless of what that token is, we precompute them and save them in a lookup table. This makes adding position encoding values super fast.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Self-Attention** is a type of attention used in Encoder-Decoder and Encoder-Only transformers. It allows every word in a phrase to define a relationship with any other word in the phrase, regardless of the order of the words. In other words, if the phrase is **The pizza came out of the oven and it tasted good!**, then the word **it** can define it's relationship with every word in that phrase, including words that came after it, like **tasted** and **good**, as illustrated by the blue arrows in the figure below.\n",

In other words, **Masked Self-Attention** prevents the transformer from \"looking ahead\". This is illustrated below where the word **it** can define relationships with itself and everything that came earlier in the input. In Encoder-Decoder transformers, **Masked Self-Attention** is used during training, when we know what the output should be, but we still force the decoder to generate it one token at a time, thus, limiting attention to only output words that came earlier. In contrast, Decoder-Only transformers use **Masked Self-Attention** all the time, on the input and the output, during training and inference. Thus, even though the Decoder-Only transformer can see all of the input during training and inference, it still only allows the attention values for each word to depend on words that came before it.\n",

For example, if the **Query** is for the first token **\\<SOS>**, then Masked Self-Attention will ignore the values calculated with **Keys** for **Let's** and **go** because those tokens come after **\\<SOS>**.\n",
